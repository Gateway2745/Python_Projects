### MOTIVATION

Being a newbie to competitive programming , one of the many things I wanted to know was the average time it takes to enrich ones
programming skills. This project also helped me in getting started with Python and impelementing some of its well-known
libraries.

### IMPROVEMENT

The data for the script was taken from the progress charts which begin from when the contestants start and continue on till present
time. Hence it does not take into account any 'breaks' which they might have taken or their prior expertise. However the value obtained
from the script does provide a quite accurate value. Improvements can be made regarding the above-mentioned pitfalls.
